# Project Name: Create your own Enumerable

## Project description:
Create a class MyList and a module MyEnumerable. MyEnumerable will implement a subset
of the functionality of Enumerable.

## Project Requirements:
Create a class MyList that has an instance variable @list.

In MyList implement a method #each that yields successive members of @list and uses the MyEnumerable module.

Create a module MyEnumerable that implements the following methods
(they should have the same funcionality as methods in Enumerable):

#all?
#any?
#filter

Each class and module should has a separate .rb file.

## Tests:

- Create our list
list = MyList.new(1, 2, 3, 4)

- Test all
puts list.all_method {|e| e < 5}
 true
puts list.all_method {|e| e > 5}
 false

- Test any
puts list.any_method {|e| e == 2}
 true
puts list.any_method {|e| e == 5}
 false

- Test filter
puts list.filter_method {|e| e.even?}
 [2, 4]
